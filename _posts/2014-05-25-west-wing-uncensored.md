> Referring to one of the stories in the pilot that was about Cuban refugees fleeing to America on inner tubes and should we or should we not send the Coast Guard out to help them, one of the execs suggested that it might be better if [Bradley Whitford&#8217;s character] Josh Lyman went out and saved them himself. I tried not to make it an awkward pause before I said, &laquo;You mean actually swim?&raquo; He said, &laquo;No, that would be ridiculous. I mean he rents a boat. A motor boat, a skiff, but the boat&#8217;s too small to get all the refugees on board and he has a moment like Oskar Schindler where he&#8217;s saying, &#8216;I could have rented a bigger boat! 

Interessant fra [The Hollywood Reporter][1] om serien som etter min (manges?) mening startet den nye gullalderen for TV.
